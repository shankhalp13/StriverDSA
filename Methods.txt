Extraction of digits:
Modulus Division of a number by 10 gives the last digits
Eg - 1233 % 10 = 3

Reversing Number:
Modulus gives last digit
so to add this last digit to some number
multiply existing number by 10 and add this number 
so is there is 0 then multiply gives 0 then add 4 = 4
if 4 is there multiply gives 40 not add 4 = 44
so adding digit is by multiply by 10 and add the last digit.
